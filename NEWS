CHANGES IN VERSION 1.19.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o railMatrix() and loadCoverage() helper functions now attempt to import a
        BigWig file 3 times before giving up. Based on
        http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/web-query/ and
        https://github.com/leekgroup/recount/commit/8da982b309e2d19638166f263057d9f85bb64e3f
        which will make these functions more robust to occasional web access
        issues.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.17.3
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add ORCID's following changes at
        http://bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/#description

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.17.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Use R's random seeds from version 3.5.0 for the test
        thanks to https://twitter.com/StrictlyStat/status/1103303028751372289

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.4
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Switched from 'outfile' to 'log' when invoking
        BiocParalle::SnowParam(). Thus define_cluster()
        now has a mc.log argument instead of mc.outfile.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fix a message regarding the deprecated IRanges subset method.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.1
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Use BiocManager


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.8
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a unit test that was breaking version 1.13.7.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.1
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added an extra example to regionMatrix() in response to
        https://support.bioconductor.org/p/103591

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.8
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Improved the documentation regarding an error when coverageInfo$position
        is NULL when running analyzeChr() [and indirectly running
        preprocessCoverage()]. See https://support.bioconductor.org/p/99400/
        for details.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.7
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Vignette now uses the new BiocStyle::html_document that was recently
        released.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.4
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o regionMatrix() will now pass the hidden arguments 'species' and
        'currentStyle' to getRegionCoverage() so they can be used by
        extendedMapSeqlevels(). Related to
        https://support.bioconductor.org/p/95721/.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.11.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Improved documentation of extendedMapSeqlevels(). Related to
        https://support.bioconductor.org/p/95521/.
    o Improved filterData() based on https://github.com/lcolladotor/derfinder/issues/38


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.6
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed define_cluster() to match recent changes in BiocParallel and
        fixed an if clause in regionMatrix() that could lead to warnings in
        some situations.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.3
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o regionMatrix() now has explicit arguments 'totalMapped' and 'targetSize'
        so that users will almost always normalize by library size when
        using this function (if they see the help page) or in the steps
        prior to using regionMatrix().

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.2
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Clarified the documentation of 'mc.cores' and 'mc.cores.load' in
        fullCoverage() thanks to feedback from Emily Burke
        https://github.com/emilyburke.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.16
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Help pages now document advanced arguments.
    o Deprecated advancedArg().


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.14
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the function getTotalMapped() for calculating the total number of
        mapped reads for a BAM file or the area under the curve (AUC) for a
        BigWig file. This information can then be used with fullCoverage(),
        filterData() and other functions. Note that if you 'totalMapped'
        in fullCoverage() you should not use 'totalMapped' again in
        filterData().


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.12
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Updated links to BrainSpan. Issue reported by Steve Semick
        https://github.com/SteveSemick.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2
------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Now derfinder uses DataFrame(check.names = FALSE) to avoid naming issues.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.1
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Dropped defunct functions.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.39
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o annotateRegions() now ignores strand by default

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.37
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The users guide vignette now has a short section explaining how to use
        derfinder for differential binding analysis with ChIP-seq data.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.27
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Added smoothing arguments for the single base-level approach based on
        functions from the bumphunter package. These arguments are useful for
        identifying differentially bounded ChIP-seq peaks.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.13
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed railMatrix()'s flexibility for defining the cluster used for loading
        the BigWig files. You can now use 'BPPARAM.railChr' which will take
        priority over 'file.cores'. Also, if 'file.cores = 1L', then the default
        will be to use SerialParam(), which was the implementation available
        prior to 1.5.11.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.11
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Now coverageToExon(), regionMatrix() and railMatrix() can take an 'L'
        argument of length equal to the number of samples in case not all
        samples have the same read length.
    o railMatrix() has a new argument called 'file.cores' for controlling how
        many cores are used for loading the BigWig files. In theory this allows
        using railMatrix() with 'BPPARAM.custom' equal to a BatchJobsParam()
        to submit 1 job per chromosome, then 'file.cores' determines the number
        of cores for reading the files. This is a highly experimental feature.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.9
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Dropped the old introductory and advanced vignettes. We think that the
        new vignettes are clearer. In particular, they do a better job at
        highlighting the differences between the expressed regions-level and
        single base-level F-statistics implementations of the DER Finder
        approach to RNA-seq data.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.8
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Added a users guide vignette which explains nearly every detail you would
        want to know as a user.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.7
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Added a quick start vignette.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.6
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Introduced railMatrix() which generates similar output to regionMatrix()
        but is much faster and less memory intensive. It achieves this by
        extracting the required information from BigWig files.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Brought back the 'mc.outfile' argument for specifying the 'outfile'
        argument in SnowParam(). See more details at
        https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2015-May/007531.html

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Deprecated functions with underscores in their names in favor of
        camelCase functions. This was done to simplify the package.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Greatly increased the speed of the p-values calculation step. See
        https://github.com/lcolladotor/derfinder/issues/29 for details.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.18
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Updated to work with qvalue 1.99.0


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.17
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Changed citation information to reference the bioRxiv pre-print

BUG FIXES

    o Polished the interaction with bumphunter >= 1.7.3
    o Updated the default cluster option now that BiocParallel::SnowParam()
        no longer has an 'outfile' argument.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.16
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o analyzeChr() now uses annotateTranscripts() and matchGenes() from
        bumphunter version 1.7.3 (or greater). As announced at
        https://support.bioconductor.org/p/63568/ these changes in bumphunter
        allow straight forward use of non-human annotation. In analyzeChr()
        using a different organism can be used by changing the 'txdb' argument:
        finer control can be achieved through '...'. For example, by specifying
        the 'annotationPackage' argument used in annotateTranscripts().

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.15
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o makeGenomicState() incorrectly labeled regions as intragenic. The correct
        name is intergenic.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.14
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed an important bug on calculatePvalues()! Basically, internally
        `maxRegionGap` was set to 300 instead of 0 in one step by default.
        Thus the process of mapping regions to genomic coordinates was messed
        up. If you have results prior to this fix you can try using
        https://gist.github.com/bf85e2c7d5d1f8197707 to fix the results as
        much as possible. Basically, regions will be correct but the
        p-values will be approximated with the available information from the
        null regions. Truly fixing the p-values can only be done by re-running
        derfinder.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.5
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Introduced function extendedMapSeqlevels() for using GenomeInfoDb when
        there is information regarding the species and naming style of interest.
        Otherwise sequence names are left unchanged. If used with
        'verbose = TRUE', a message is printed whenever GenomeInfoDb could not
        be used or if some information had to be guessed.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixes https://support.bioconductor.org/p/62136

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o loadCoverage() and fullCoverage() now support BamFile and BigWigFile
        objects

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug in loadCoverage() when the input was a BamFileList.
        Implemented tests based on the bug. Bug reported at
        https://support.bioconductor.org/p/62073


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Preparing to submit to Bioconductor.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.81
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added an advanced vignette.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.80
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Introductory vignette completed.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.79
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o mergeResults() can now calculate FWER adjusted p-values when provided with
        'optionsStats'. Updated analyzeChr() to supply the required information.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.78
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added an introductory vignette.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.77
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added advancedArg() [and its alias advanced_arg()] which links to the docs
        for the advanced arguments by opening a browser window with the relevant
        information from GitHub.
    o getRegionCoverage() and coverageToExon() now have the 'files' argument
        which is used only when 'fullCov' is NULL. Both functions will attempt
        to extract the coverage data from the raw files for the regions of
        interest in that case.

        Special care has to be taken in order to guarantee that the coverage is
        the same as some reads might be discarded if the region is too narrow.
        See the advanced argument 'protectWhich' in loadCoverage() for more
        information. Also, if 'totalMapped' and 'targetSize' were used prior to
        filtering, they should be used again.
    o loadCoverage() has new advanced arguments that help when reading a
        specific region (or regions) of the genome.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.76
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o loadCoverage() and fullCoverage() argument 'dirs' has been renamed to
        'files' for greater consistency with what it represents.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.75
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o regionMatrix() now returns the output of getRegionCoverage() so you don't
        have to run it twice if you are interested in using
        derfinderPlot::plotRegionCoverage()
    o regionMatrix()$regions now guesses the seqlengths

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed .advanced_argument() to work in nested functions
    o Fixed a case in getRegionCoverage() where fullCov$position was provided
        but it was NULL.
    o Fixed regionMatrix(totalMapped, targetSize) case which would previously
        lead to an error in the getRegionCoverage() step.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.74
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Most functions had their arguments changed to increase usability. Some
        have advanced arguments inside the code.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.71
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Introduced coerceGR(), createBwSample() and createBw() for exporting
        output from fullCoverage() into BigWig files.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.70
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o All exported functions now have aliases with underscore names for those
        that prefer them over camel case names. For example, analyze_chr() is
        the new alias for analyzeChr().
    o makeBamList() has been renamed to rawFiles() since it can be used to
        identify a list of BigWig files instead of BAM files.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.69
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o loadCoverage() and fullCoverage() now have a 'tilewidth' argument. When
        specified GenomicFiles is used to read the coverage in chunks. In
        theory, this can lead to lower memory usage at the expense of time.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.67
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o preprocessCoverage() now has a 'toMatrix' argument which is only used when
        'lowMemDir' is not NULL. It controls whether to save the chunks as
        DataFrame objects or dgCMatrix objects and the idea is that it can time
        by just transforming the data once instead of doing so at each
        permutation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.66
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o fstats.apply() has been moved to it's own package: derfinderHelper. This
        will speed up the run time when using BiocParallel::SnowParam() as
        derfinderHelper takes much less time to load than derfinder.
    o plotCluster(), plotOverview() and plotRegionCoverage() were all moved to
        their new own package: derfinderPlot. This will make maintenance easier
        as the dependency ggbio is still under active development.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.65
-------------------------

    o Re-organized code for fstats.apply(). Note that improving
        .transformSparseMatrix() would speed up the 'Matrix' method.
    o Note that all parallel functions have some overhead from loading derfinder
        on each worker. Check system.time(library(derfinder)) to see how long
        the overhead is. It only pays off to use more cores if the calculations
        are taking longer than the overhead.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.64
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o fullCoverage() has several new arguments and now is a full parallel
        implementation of loadCoverage(). These changes were introduced since
        fullCoverage() no longer blows up in memory since version 0.0.62 and
        thus the new recommended use case is to call fullCoverage() instead of
        running one job with loadCoverage() per chromosome or using a lapply()
        loop.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.63
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o fstats.apply() now has 'method' and 'scalefac' arguments. The 'method'
        argument controls which of the 3 implementations to use. The old method
        is called 'regular' now. The new method 'Rle' calculates the
        F-statistics without de-compressing the data, which is good for memory
        but gets considerably slower as the number of samples increases. The
        default method is 'Matrix' which uses the Matrix package and is both
        faster (given that the coercion doesn't take long) and less memory
        intensive than the 'regular' method.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Functions analyzeChr(), calculatePvalues() and calculateStats() now have
        arguments 'method' and 'scalefac' to match the changes in fstats.apply()

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.62
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o derfinder now uses BiocParallel::blapply() instead of parallel::mclapply()
        When 'mc.cores' is greater than 1, BiocParallel::SnowParam() is used to
        construct the cluster. Otherwise, BiocParallel::SerialParam() is used.
        This change reduces memory load when using the functions that have the
        'mc.cores' argument greater than 1.

    o Functions analyzeChr(), calculatePvalues(), calculateStats(),
        coverageToExon(), fullCoverage(), getRegionCoverage(), regionMatrix()
        all have a new argument 'mc.output'. This is passed to
        BiocParallel::SnowParam(outfile).

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o You may now use fullCoverage() without problems and should no longer
        encounter errors due to longer vectors not being implemented.
    o Functions like fullCoverage() now use much less memory and do not blow up
        as you increase 'mc.cores'. Note however that the memory does increase,
        but now it's close to linear.
    o Examples might take longer to run with 'mc.cores' greater than 1, but that
        is due to the small setup overhead of BiocParallel::SnowParam() which
        is minimal compared to the overall speed gains with real data sets.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.61
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o filterData() and loadCoverage() now have arguments 'totalMapped' and
        'targetSize'
    o getRegionCoverage() and regionMatrix() can now work with list output from
        loadCoverage() with a non-NULL cutoff
    o regionMatrix() now has an argument 'runFilter' so it can be used with
        previous output from loadCoverage()/filterData() with 'returnMean=TRUE'

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.60
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o analyzeChr(), annotateRegions(), calculatePvalues(), coverageToExon(),
        findRegions(), fullCoverage(), getRegionCoverage(),
        makeGenomicState(), mergeResults(), plotCluster(), plotOverview()
        now all have 'chrsStyle' as an argument to specify the chromosome
        naming convention used. Defaults to UCSC.
    o makeGenomicState() no longer has the 'addChrPrefix' argument. It has been
        replaced by 'chrsStyle' to use GenomeInfoDb to set the naming style.
    o 'chrnums' has been renamed to 'chrs' in fullCoverage() and mergeResults()
    o 'chrnum' has been renamed to 'chr' in analyzeChr()

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.59
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Updated to work with BioC version 3.0

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.58
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o loadCoverage() and fullCoverage() can now import data from BigWig files.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.57
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o regionMatrix() now relies on getRegionCoverage() instead of
        coverageToExon() making it faster and less memory intensive.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.56
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added regionMatrix() for filtering coverage data and using the resulting
        regions to construct a count matrix. Uses several derfinder functions.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Made coverageToExon() more robust for different names in 'fullCov'.
    o filterData() and loadCoverage() have new arguments 'filter', 'returnMean',
        and 'returnCoverage' which allow speeding up regionMatrix().
        preprocessCoverage() was changed accordingly.
    o getRegionCoverage() now internally uses USCS names.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed warnings in coverageToExon().


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.55
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Added a NEWS file with curated information from the git commit history.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.54
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Added example data for mergeResults(). Now all functions have examples.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.53
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Now derfinder includes the genomic state output for hg19 chr21. This
        allowed to implement examples for annotateRegions(),
        getRegionCoverage(), plotRegionCoverage, and coverageToExon().


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.52
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Several examples run much faster now

        https://github.com/lcolladotor/derfinder/pull/17
    o Stored the results from some of the example data to speed up other
        examples. Check ?genomeDataRaw, ?genomeFstats, ?genomeRegions

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed 'verbose' for getRegionCoverage()
    o plotRegionCoverage() now matches latest getRegionCoverage() output

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.44
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Updated getRegionCoverage() with a new method for sub setting the coverage
        matrices, allowing for coverage estimates from overlapping regions. Now
        also uses mclapply().

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed NAMESPACE to match current bioc-devel (2.14) as suggested by Tim
        Triche.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.42
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o A series of performance enhancements were made to reduce the memory load
         (albeit a very minor time increase).

BUG FIXES

    o Updated analyzeChr() to handle correctly the new 'lowMemDir' argument.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.41
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Introduced the 'lowMemDir' argument to preprocessCoverage(),
        calculateStats(), calculatePvalues(), fstats.apply(), and analyzeChr().
        Reduces peak memory usage at the expense of some input-output.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.40
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o mergeResults() will not merge pre-processed data by default
    o coverageToExon() now uses mclapply() when possible

        in generateReport()

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.24
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed plotRegionCoverage() for cases when in annotateRegions(minoverlap=x)
        lead to no overlaps being found between a region and annotation.

        found.
    o Fixed an issue when 'testvars' in makeModels() had unused levels.
    o Fixed an issue when qvalue::qvalue() fails due to incorrect estimation of
        pi0
    o Fixed a bug on how the regions were being clustered.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.22
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o MA-style plots in generateReport() now weight the mean by the number of
